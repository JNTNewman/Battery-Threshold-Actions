# Battery Threshold Actions

To help ensure longevity of your laptop battery, this python based utility was created to check battery levels at intervals and notify either to plug out or to plug in and charge.

Lenovo Vantage software can take care of this but I am uncertain of other platforms. So, this utility will help you preserve your battery's life.

In the `bta.config file`, you set the lower and upper threshold levels and intervals that the program should check battery level

You can run `exec ./bta.sh` in the folder or directly or set it up to run automatically on startup.
